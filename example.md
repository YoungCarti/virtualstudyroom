2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS) 🧠
Idea: Instead of just flipping through cards randomly, implement a "Smart Study" mode (like Anki).
How: When a user flips a card, ask “How well did you know this?” (Again, Hard, Good, Easy). Schedule the card to reappear based on their answer (e.g., 10 mins, 1 day, 4 days).
Value: This is the gold standard for learning apps.
