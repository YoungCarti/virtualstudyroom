1. 💾 Save Flashcard Decks (Highly Recommended)
Currently, if you generate flashcards, edit them, and leave the page, they are lost. We could add a "Save Deck" feature:

Save the generated (and edited) questions to Firestore.
Create a "My Library" tab where students can browse their saved decks (e.g., "Biology Ch.1", "History Exam").
Why: Students don't want to re-generate (and re-pay API costs) every time they study.


2. 🧠 Spaced Repetition (SRS)
Upgrade the flashcard viewer to be "Smart":

Instead of just "Unsure/Sure", use buttons like "Again", "Hard", "Good", "Easy".
Use a simple algorithm to schedule when the card appears again (e.g., "Hard" = see it again in 1 min, "Easy" = see it tomorrow).
Why: This is the gold standard for studying (like Anki or Quizlet).


3. 📤 Share to Class/Group
Since you have Group Chats and Classes:

Add a "Share" button to the Quiz/Flashcard generator.
Allow sending a generated quiz or study deck directly to a group chat.
Why: Makes the app collaborative and "sticky".

4. 🗣️ AI Voice Study Mode
Add a "Listen Mode" for flashcards:

Use Text-to-Speech (TTS) so the app reads the question aloud.
(Optional) Use Speech-to-Text so the student can say the answer.
Why: Great for studying while walking or commuting.
5. 🏆 Gamification
XP & Levels: Earn +10 XP for finishing a quiz or flashcard set.
