1. 💾 Save Flashcard Decks (Highly Recommended)
Currently, if you generate flashcards, edit them, and leave the page, they are lost. We could add a "Save Deck" feature:

Save the generated (and edited) questions to Firestore.
Create a "My Library" tab where students can browse their saved decks (e.g., "Biology Ch.1", "History Exam").
Why: Students don't want to re-generate (and re-pay API costs) every time they study.

3. Quiz History & Analytics 📊
Idea: Track the user's quiz scores over time.
Features:
"My Progress" tab showing graphs of improvement.
Breakdown of weak topics (e.g., "You consistently miss questions about State Management").

2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS) 🧠
Idea: Instead of just flipping through cards randomly, implement a "Smart Study" mode (like Anki).
How: When a user flips a card, ask “How well did you know this?” (Again, Hard, Good, Easy). Schedule the card to reappear based on their answer (e.g., 10 mins, 1 day, 4 days).
Value: This is the gold standard for learning apps.

4. Group Quiz Challenges 🏆
Idea: Since you have "Share to Group," take it further with a Leaderboard.
How: When a user shares a quiz, anyone who takes it logs their score to a shared leaderboard message in the chat. "Reshtva just scored 90% on 'Dart Basics' - Beat that!"


5. 🏆 Gamification
XP & Levels: Earn +10 XP for finishing a quiz or flashcard set.
